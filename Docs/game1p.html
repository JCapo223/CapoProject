		<p id="desc">This game is one of the first games that I made. It is about a character who can jump an unlimited amount of time in mid-air. The challenge comes from the very tight platforming required to get through the levels. There is a total of 58 levels in the game, each more difficult than the last. There are even different “worlds” that focus around a different main gimic. For example, world 2 introduces moving platforms. World 4 introduces alien beings that can only move if the player is moving.</p>
