		<p>Recharger is a game where you play as a square that fights against other shapes. the gimic is that you only have one bar that functions as your heath and ammunition. If you fire too much then you will not have any heath to survive enemy attacks. When not firing or taking damage your heath quickly regenerates. The objective is to use this ability to defeat a series of complex boss enemies. The bosses have a set pattern that must be discovered and mastered in order to beat.</p>
